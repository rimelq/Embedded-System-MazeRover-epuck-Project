# MazeRover - Embedded System for e-puck2  

## Project Overview  
This project, **MazeRover**, was developed as part of the **EPFL MICRO-315 - Embedded Systems & Robotics** course. It features the **e-puck2** robot programmed to navigate a portable **labyrinth** in a **semi-autonomous** manner using **real-time control with ChibiOS RTOS**.  

The system leverages **infrared proximity sensors** and an **IMU accelerometer** to detect obstacles and adjust its trajectory. The labyrinthâ€™s **inclination**, manually controlled by the user, influences the robotâ€™s movement path.

## Features  
âœ” **Semi-Autonomous Navigation** â€“ The robot moves through the maze and reacts to obstacles.  
âœ” **Real-Time Embedded System** â€“ Runs on **ChibiOS RTOS**, ensuring precise multitasking.  
âœ” **Infrared Proximity Sensors** â€“ Detects obstacles and prevents collisions.  
âœ” **IMU-Based Control** â€“ Uses an accelerometer to adjust movement based on labyrinth inclination.  
âœ” **Multithreading Implementation** â€“ Efficient thread management for real-time execution.

## Hardware & Software  
### **Hardware Components**  
- **e-puck2 robot**  
- **Infrared proximity sensors** (front, left, and right)  
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)** for inclination detection  
- **MDF-based labyrinth** for navigation testing  

### **Software & Tools**  
- **ChibiOS RTOS** (Real-Time Operating System)  
- **C programming** for firmware development  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  
- **Fusion 360** for labyrinth design

## System Architecture & Multithreading  
The system is divided into **modular components**, each running in its own **thread** under ChibiOS:

1. **Main Thread** â€“ Initializes system components and manages communication.  
2. **IR Sensor Thread** â€“ Reads proximity data and prevents collisions.  
3. **Motor Controller Thread** â€“ Adjusts motor speeds based on sensor inputs.  
4. **IMU Thread** â€“ Detects inclination and updates movement strategy.  

### **Multithreading Logic**

## Navigation Strategy  
The **MazeRover** follows **three predefined paths** (Red, Green, Blue) inside the labyrinth. The robot adapts its movement to avoid collisions while progressing toward its goal.

Key control strategies include:  
âœ” **Obstacle Avoidance** â€“ Adjusts speed based on infrared sensor input.  
âœ” **Smooth Navigation** â€“ Applies speed corrections to avoid erratic movements.  
âœ” **Inclination-Based Turning** â€“ Uses IMU data to determine turns.
